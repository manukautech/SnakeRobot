Work in progress as at 08 Dec 2017.
Code for Arduino Nano microcontrollers in use as the servo controllers.
This code is for the "master" Nano "nano02" which we connect to a HC-05 unit 
which is the interface via "bluetooth" to the mobile phone "brain".
TODO is the code for I2C connection to "nano01" and "nano03".

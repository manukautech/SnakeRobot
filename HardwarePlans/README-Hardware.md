Photos of the prototype may look different to the plans.  
The plans include lessons learned from building the prototype.

I have tried 2 different kinds of servo-link-ball-joints:

1. The "DUBRO" 2133-Y 2mm Swivel Ball Link comes in packets of 2. <br /> The single ball link cost is about USD 1.00 to USD 2.50 depending on supplier and quantity you buy.
2. The "HobbyKing" 2mm Brass Ball Link (10pieces per bag) SKU 310000121 has a unit cost of about USD 0.33

In my opinion the HobbyKing or similar design is the one to use when 3D printing a "rib" with a suitable mount built into the design. You can see it in the prototype photos as my exercise in trying out ideas fro a 3D printed rib. However when going craft modelmaking with plywood, wire and glue the DUBRO is a lot faster to work with. The coloured ball mount with the bolt screwed in becomes the frame mount and the pushrod can be quickly cut and shaped with wire without any need to glue the wire into the ball mount as happens with the "HobbyKing". My experience is that the "DUBRO" cost is worth the time saving.

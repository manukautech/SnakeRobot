# XMSnakeRobot
Hardware plans and software. Work in progress with a single segment proof of concept achieved as of Nov 2017.
Now under construction is a 10-segment snake to act as the testbed to start work on software for movement and performance.

Part of the "Creative Repurposing of Accessible Technologies" Project at the Manukau Institute of Technology in New Zealand.
Here the Accessible Technologies are:
- Low cost Android SmartPhone or Android SmartWatch for the robot "brain"
- Arduino Nano microcontrollers for the robot "spinal cord"
- Bluetooth HC-05 module as the link between "spinal cord" and "brain"
- SG-90 model aircraft servos - 20 of them. 
  The snake has 10 segments each of which has servos for horizontal and vertical movement.

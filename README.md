# XMSnakeRobot
Hardware plans and software. Work in progress with a single segment proof of concept achieved as of Nov 2017.
Now under construction is a 10-segment snake to act as the testbed to start work on software for movement and performance.  

Why a Snake Robot? For hunting rats! Here in New Zealand we have rats etc, alien to these previously isolated islands, harming our much loved native bird populations including the national icon - the Kiwi. Think of a remote controlled small robot in the world of the rat and that world has mud, undergrowth and broken terrain where a snake form factor is worth trying. And we can get "bio-inspired" and realise that snakes are effective bio rat-hunters so it may be good to learn from them. This is an ambitious aim to build to step by step with an indoor testbed first. If rat-hunting does not work out then there are plenty of other possibilities like robot circus performer and Youtube stardom. Cats can be stars on Youtube so maybe snake robots can be the next big thing!

Part of the "Creative Repurposing of Accessible Technologies" Project at the Manukau Institute of Technology in New Zealand.<br/>
Here the Accessible Technologies are:
- Low cost Android SmartPhone or Android SmartWatch for the robot "brain"
- Arduino Nano microcontrollers for the robot "spinal cord"
- Bluetooth HC-05 module as the link between "spinal cord" and "brain"
- SG-90 model aircraft servos - 20 of them. 
  The snake has 10 segments each of which has servos for horizontal and vertical movement.

Hardware plans and software. Work in progress with a single segment proof of concept achieved. 

Part of the "Creative Repurposing of Accessible Technologies" Project at the Manukau Institute of Technology in New Zealand.
Here the Accessible Technologies are:
- Low cost Android SmartPhone for the robot "brain"
- Arduino Nano microcontrollers for the robot "spinal cord"
- Bluetooth HC-05 module as the link between "spinal cord" and "brain"
- SG-90 model aircraft servos - 20 of them. 
  The snake has 10 segments each of which has 2 x servos for horizontal and vertical movement.
